# SAFE-Note-Translations
Translating Safe Financing Documents into different languages and adopt local regulation on the terms

# Safe Financing Documents
According to Y combinator, "Y Combinator introduced the safe (simple agreement for future equity) in late 2013, and since then, it has been used by almost all YC startups and countless non-YC startups as the main instrument for early-stage fundraising."  You can find an English version of it at https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/

Open Term Sheet is a project where we translate the SAFE note into different langauges and adopt regulation regulation on the terms, so that entrepeneur can use the same term sheet with their local investors in accordance with the logal regulations.  Our goal is make it easier for entrepeneurs to raise funding in their regions, and help to standardize the term sheets across the world.

We will initially support Spanish and Turkish.  If you would like to translate the term sheet into another langauge and support this open source project please feel free to contact us.
